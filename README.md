# WTWR Web Application

**WTWR** is a weather-based clothing recommendation web application built with React. Users can browse clothing items suitable for the current weather, add new items, delete items, update their profile, and toggle temperature units between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The project emphasizes React context, modular architecture, API integration, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop users.
